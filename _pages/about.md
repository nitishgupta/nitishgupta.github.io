I am PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing research in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am advised by [Prof. Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and co-advised by [Prof. Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/), UCI.

My research focuses on developing structured models for grounded language understanding, primarily in the context of making machines understand and answer questions against text. I am particularly interested in models that perform reasoning by understanding the compositional nature of language, and are able to provide a formal semantic parse and an explanation about their predictions.

I am fortunate enough to have gotten the opportunity to work with excellent researchers in the field. I work closely with [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/), [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/), and have worked as an intern with [Tom Kwiatkowski](https://research.google/people/105075/), [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Mike Lewis](https://research.fb.com/people/lewis-mike/), [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/).

Before coming to UPenn, I received my B.Tech - M.Tech dual degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; Prof. [Harish Karnick](http://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick#) was my thesis advisor.
