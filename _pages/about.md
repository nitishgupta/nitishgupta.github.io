I am a research scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) in the [Language team](https://research.google/teams/language/).
My research focuses on developing machine learning models that can reason about natural languages, with a primary focus on question answering and reasoning.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/).
I am fortunate enough to have gotten the opportunity to work with excellent researchers in the field. I have worked closely with [Prof. Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/), UCI and [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/), [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). As an intern, I have worked with [Tom Kwiatkowski](https://research.google/people/105075/), [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Mike Lewis](https://research.fb.com/people/lewis-mike/), [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/).

Previously, I received my B.Tech - M.Tech dual degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; Prof. [Harish Karnick](http://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick#) was my thesis advisor.
